# Iris Flower Classification - Machine Learning Example

This project demonstrates a basic machine learning workflow using the popular **Scikit-Learn** library in Python. The script builds a **Decision Tree Classifier** to classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica based on their features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width).

## Introduction

This project provides a simple example of how to build, train, and evaluate a machine learning model in Python using Scikit-Learn. The Iris dataset is used, which is a standard dataset in the field of machine learning and is ideal for beginners to understand the basic concepts of classification.

## Features

- **Model Training**: Train a Decision Tree Classifier on the Iris dataset.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy score and classification report.
- **Prediction**: Predict the species of new iris samples.
- **Easy to Understand**: A simple, well-commented script to help beginners grasp the fundamentals of machine learning.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Scikit-Learn

### Install Scikit-Learn

If you haven't already installed Scikit-Learn, you can do so using pip:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/iris-classification.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**:

   Go to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd iris-classification
   ```

3. **Run the Script**:

   Run the script using Python:

   ```bash
   python iris_classification.py
   ```

### Running the Program

Once the script is running, it will:

- Load the Iris dataset.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Train a Decision Tree Classifier on the training data.
- Evaluate the model using accuracy and a detailed classification report.
- Predict the species of a new sample.

## Examples

### Output

Running the script will produce an output similar to:

```
Model Accuracy: 0.98

Classification Report:
              precision    recall  f1-score   support

    setosa       1.00      1.00      1.00        16
    versicolor   1.00      0.92      0.96        12
    virginica    0.92      1.00      0.96        12

    accuracy                           0.98        40
   macro avg       0.98      0.98      0.98        40
weighted avg       0.98      0.98      0.98        40

Predicted Species: setosa
```

### Predicting New Samples

To predict the species of a new iris flower, you can modify the `new_sample` variable in the script:

```python
new_sample = [[5.0, 3.6, 1.4, 0.2]]  # Example features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width
```

Run the script again to see the predicted species.
